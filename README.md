# 🎤 Voice Quiz Game

An **accessible, voice-controlled educational quiz game** built with JavaScript and the Web Speech API.  
Players answer spoken questions using their **voice**, and the game gives feedback using **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**.  

Designed with accessibility in mind, especially for **blind or visually impaired learners**. The game starts with simple questions (colors, animals, basic math) and gradually increases in difficulty (history, science, logic).
